1. A method inherited from a base class can be used a implement of a interface's method.
2. When override, be careful of the access modifier, which should not be smaller.
3. When using unicode such as '\u0001', don't forget the the single quotes.
4. Be careful of the static variable when calculating the count to the garbage collection.
5. Needs packages imports when check if can compile
6. Nested enum is same with or without static. It can not refer the outer class variable
7. Array declaration can not have size. new int [5][] is OK. but either int [5][] = null or new int [][5] is not OK. When {}, can not have size
8. Be cautious of the import for the compilation
9. In try(), there can only be declaring variables with Close/Autoclose
10. Note that the inner class should be static when used in the static method such as main
11. Be careful about for(int i=0; ++i<10;){}
12. Generics weren’t introduced until Java 5.
13. Be careful about the upper or lower. java Boombox to call class BoomBox will raise NoClassDefFoundError
14. Be careful if there is really a extends or implement
15. The output of the assert should also be considered as an output
16. Wrong: When javac is using files within a JAR file, it will unJAR the file during compilation.
17. Integer[] a = {1, null};for (int i : a) { System.out.println(i);} will 1 java.lang.NullPointerException
18. System.console() is factory
19. Note that Arrays.binarySearch() doesn’t throw an exception when passed an unsorted array, it just returns an unpredictable (usually negative) result.
20. A Hashtable does NOT allow any null keys OR null values, but HashMap can have null values.
21. new A(); the object can be collected in the next line
22. StringBuilder does not override equals() and hashCode().
23. Jar can be worked with path together, such as : java -classpath .:test/MyJar.jar GoDeep
24. 实现Comparable<Score >接口必须实现comparTo<Score >方法！注意与Compartor接口区分开来，Compartor接口要求实现compare方法。
25. mkdir() no checked exception, Integer.parseInt has NumberFormatException which is not checked either
26. /home/bob/downloads/*.jar这种写法无效，因为如果有两个jar包都存在games.Chess，系统不知道是哪一个。
28. switch doesn't support boolean or long
29. DateFormat and NumberFormat, Calendar supports GetInstance(locale), but can't do df.SetLocale() etc. Locale.setDefault() should be set before GetInstance();
30. 如果value中有空格，则需要用双引号将该值括起来，如-Dname=”space string”。 System.getProperty("prop.custom"); 和 System.getProperties().getProperty("prop.custom");
31.可变长参数类型和另外的不可变长参数类型都符合要求，这种情况下，虚拟机会先抛开可变长参数的方法，查找有没有能直接匹配的方法，如果找到再运行，否则去查找可变长参数的方法
32. 父类仅有带参数的构造器，没有默认构造器，这要注意
33. Jar引用时不支持通配符
35. setMaximumFractionDigits是设置小数点后的数字的最max个数~~, setMinimumFractionDigits是设置小数点后的数字的最min个数~~, setMinimumIntegerDigits是设置小数点前的数字的最min个数~~
36. When to replace a StringBuffer object with a StringBuilder object? 
    When using versions of Java technology earlier than 5.0. Or When sharing a StringBuffer among multiple threads.
37. Arrays.sort to sort a Array. Collections.sort to sort a List. new TreeSet(s) to sort a set
38. 可以用super.f()或者Base.f()引用父类的静态函数。不过super不存在于静态函数中。
39. public static void takeList(List<? extends A> list) {
		list = new ArrayList<B>();  //work. because a totally new list
		list.add(new B()); // not work. the list may has other objs rather than B.
	}
40. %[arg_index$][flags][width][.precision]conversion char,
    - Left-justify this argument
    + Include a sign (+ or -) with this argument
    0 Pad this argument with zeroes
    , Use locale-specific grouping separators (i.e., the comma in 123,456)
    ( Enclose negative numbers in parentheses
    width This value indicates the minimum number of characters to print (totally including the '.')
    precision only counts the ones after '.'
41. String s = "123.456xyz"; NumberFormat.getInstance().parse(s) can get "123.456"
    Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce a number. The method may not use the entire text of the given string. 
42. Method-local inner classes can use variables from their enclosing methods, only if they are marked "final". Strictly in exam
43. primitive type convert first, then auto-box
44. It’s possible for objects, on whom finalize() has been invoked by the JVM, to avoid the GC.
45. File.list() returns a String[] that contains the names of both the files AND subdirectories within the directory specified. Note that the current directory and its contents are not included.
46. It’s legal for an overriding method to throw fewer exceptions, and runtime exceptions are in a class hierarchy separate from checked exceptions
47. Be careful to import some stuff for this program to compile
48. Static method can not use class's general type
49. Integer i = 1; i will never be collectable
50. Collections not Collection has sort()
51. 优先级中 == 大于 ^&|
52. When a class implements and extends, the extends declaration comes first. Interface can intend more than interfaces
53. Don't think too much about the volatile things in exam
54. The Boolean(String) constructor and valueOf() views null Strings AND Strings that don’t have the value of "true" (case-insensitive) to be false. But print("%b", v). only when null or false, will print false.
55. java -ea, -da, -dsa, -esa
56. Regular and method inner classes cannot have static declarations
57. natural order mean ascII. 1234 先于 ABC 先于 abc
58. "\\." tells the split method to split Strings whenever the character "." is encountered.
59. enum EE (ee). print(ee). will only output ee. but if ee.getClass() will EE.ee
60. there is no super.super no way to refer the grandpa's things.
61. Object[] oa = s.toArray(); oa have copy. But can not cast, such Integer[]
62. If you invoke a .class file with no main(), the static init blocks will execute before throwing a NoSuchMethodError exception.
63. protected void java.lang.Object.finalize() throws Throwable
64. interface Clickable { void click(); } interface Keyboard extends Clickable { void clic k(); } is OK
65. Organic<? extends Organic> compound = new Aliphatic<Organic>(); like void f(Organic<? extends Organic> compound);
66. TreeSets, the default iteration order is ascending. 但PriorityQueu就不是了
67. when check the class relationship need make sure they can compile
68. Which can appropriately be thrown by a programmer using Java SE technology to create a desktop application? NumberFormatException
69. case default: not correct
71 .String[] tokens = test.split("\s"); compile error. should be "\\s"
72. implements Runnable, Cloneable more than interfaces
73. Long and Int l >= -128 && l <= 127 will use cache. Otherwise will new
